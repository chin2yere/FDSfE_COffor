This assignment was all about hypothesis testing. We were to create a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis for a data set. We were also expected to set a p value and then explore the data.  The exploration process would reveal another p value which will determine whether we are to reject the null hypothesis or not.
Through this assignment, I was able to practice major functions for exploring data. I also learned how to divide data into groups with conditional statements.
I worked alone for the most part of this project, but when I reached a roadblock, I consulted Ibitoye Iteoluwa and Otutu Valerie.
